Here, I used C++ to build a small ATM project.
Therefore, the features of an ATM will be implemented utilising OOP principles in this small project.
The features are as follows:
1) Check the balance: The user is able to do so.
2) Cash WithDraw: A user may withdraw cash from an ATM, but only under certain circumstances. For example, the withdrawal amount must be less than the balance of the user's account.
3. User Information: User may view and verify information with the bank.
4) Modify Mobile No. : The user has the option to modify the mobile number associated with the bank account.
